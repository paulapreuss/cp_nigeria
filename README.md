Repository to host code related to CP nigeria project

## Get started

## Docs

To build the docs simply go to the `docs` folder

    cd docs

Install the requirements

    pip install -r docs_requirements.txt

## Code linting

In this template, 3 possible linters are proposed:
- flake8 only sends warnings and error about linting (PEP8)
- pylint sends warnings and error about linting (PEP8) and also allows warning about imports order
- black sends warning but can also fix the files for you

You can perfectly use the 3 of them or subset, at your preference.
